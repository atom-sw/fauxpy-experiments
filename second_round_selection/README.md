# Second round selection

## Purpose

The purpose of this phase is that we go through the experimental 
data generated by running the bash scripts and find those that did
not finish successfully. We analyze
these cases manually and fix them if possible. For instance, if
the problem is caused by a bug in FauxPy, we fix it, or
if it is due to server crash, we remove the data and repeat that
experiment. However, sometimes the problems cannot be fixed for
the following reasons:

1. Due to missing requirements, some buggy versions cannot run all their
test cases while they have enough of their requirements to run
their target failing tests. The reason is that some Python projects
have two sets of requirements: one for development and one for usage.
The are some cases of bugs in BugsInPy that do not include the first one.

2. Due to timeout, some buggy versions do not finish. The cluster server
we used for the experiments had a timeout limit of 48 hours, and buggy
versions that required more than 48 hours, could not be used
in our experiments.

We also go through the fishy results. A run is fishy if it does not have any
record in its csv files, or all of the records in a csv file are of 
the same score. If a fishy run is correct, we add it 
to the [correct_fishy.csv](correct_fishy.csv) file so that we do not
analyze them in other iterations of the second round selection.

After finding those that have problems, we check them manually to see if the 
problems can be fixed. If they cannot be fixed, we add them
to the [manually_removed_bugs.csv](manually_removed_bugs.csv) file, which is
then transformed into file [manually_removed_bugs.json](manually_removed_bugs.json).
Then, we copy `manually_removed_bugs.json` to the
first round selection directory and run the simulation again
to find replacements for the ones that were removed at this phase.

To perform this phase, we followed [the rules](https://github.com/mohrez86/fauxpy_experiments/blob/main/second_round_selection/check_experimental_results.py#L195-L201)
in script [check_experimental_results.py](check_experimental_results.py).

Before running this phase, set the variables in [path_items.json](path_items.json).
Variable `RESULTS_PATH` points to the path of results directory explained in
the main [README.md](/README.md) of the repository,
and variable `SCRIPTS_PATH` points to the scripts
directory.
