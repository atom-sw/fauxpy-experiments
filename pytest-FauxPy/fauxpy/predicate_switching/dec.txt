- Predicate switching is done for a single failing test.

- Implementing LEFS is possible. Implementing PRIOR might
 not be possible.

- Maybe we do not implement LEFS either and report a list of critical
predicates, something similar to the base paper.

- For crashing bugs, if switching prevents the program from crashing
but the crash location is not executed, the predicate is not critical.

- To avoid infinite loops: This problem is handled by maintaining
an internal basic block counter and if this counter exceeds a
certain very large preset value, the execution is aborted and
search is continued using the next predicate.
