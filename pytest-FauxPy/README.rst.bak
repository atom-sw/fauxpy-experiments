Installation

Usage

Limitations
-----
The SBFL/MBFL family uses coverage.py to collect execution traces. So, any limitation of coverage.py is a limitation of the SBFL/MBFL family.

The stack trace family does not work with --tb=native of pytest. Do not use it in command line mode or in pytest.ini file.

The ps family uses sys.settrace function. So, any limitation of sys.settrace is a limitation of the ps family.
Also, for some projects (e.g., cookiecutter), pytest must be executed using --no-cov.

Contributing
------------
Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.
